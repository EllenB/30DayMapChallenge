# 30DayMapChallenge 2024

Here I will post some of the maps I am making. Extra codes and notes I will add once I clean them up as this competition goes at a neck breaking pace as I discovered this code only at the end of October :blush: Most of the codes are still messy as it is a lot of trail and error.

Some maps are in QGIS, some in Python.

## Day 1: Points - QGIS

## Day 2: Lines (Python)

## Day 3: Polygons

## Day 4: Hexagons

## Day 5: FINISHED BUT STRUGGLING TO HOST THE INTERACTIVE MAP

## Day 6: IN PROGRESS

## Day 7: Vintage
